=========

a proof-of-concept app with meteor js, simple counting app that measures occupancy for a business

- The app is built with http://meteor.com/
- The app uses https://github.com/crazytoad/meteor-collectionapi, which is not a meteor smart package
- As a consequence the app needs to be run via meteorite, https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite
